## Hello world!

This is a test about a specific workflow called **git Flow**.

We are trying to find the best solution for our team.

Adding a bugfix to release

typing hotfix changes

I am adding new info here to see if will be removed or what will happend if a don't rebase my changes from develop and I just merge (without and updated develp based branch)

New example: Now I am adding code in a new feature (feature/4)

I just solve the conflicts directly on the github PR addign both new lines and adding this last one to explain it.
